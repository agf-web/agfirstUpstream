# Cyberwoven Blocks

This modules provides a few blocks that are nearly universal on all sites and rarely need custom markup:

* Copyright: allows you to set the organization name in config, and provides a block that will set the copyright correctly and includes the Cyberwoven link.
* Social Media: typically used in the footer this module provides a list of links to a set of social media outlets.
* Unmasquerade: Provides a more reliable unmasquerade link that can be placed outside the toolbar.
